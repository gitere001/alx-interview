# 0x03. Log Parsing

## Introduction
<p>For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, we apply knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:</p>


## Concepts covered
Concepts Needed:
